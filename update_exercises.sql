-- All albums in your table.

-- After each SELECT add an UPDATE statement to:

-- Make all the albums 10 times more popular (sales * 10)
-- Move all the albums before 1980 back to the 1800s.
-- Change 'Michael Jackson' to 'Peter Jackson'
-- Add SELECT statements after each UPDATE so you can see the results of your handiwork.
